        <p>I worked as a developer in C++ and Java doing desktop and backend work for a few years.  I took some time off to raise my kids and am now heading back into development.</p>

        <p>I was raised in Arlington, VA, next to Washington, DC.  Hot, humid, and traffic is a mess.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>LEGO is one of the only companies that can release an almost infinite number of new products, without actually creating any new products.</li>
          <li>GoFundMe is turning into the internet version of panhandling.</li>
          <li>Someday you will take a picture of yourself - or someone will take one of you - not knowing it will be your memorial picture when you die.</li>
          <li>No one has seen you look worse than the gas station closest to your house.</li>
          <li>When cousins from both sides of the families meet itâ€™s like a special crossover episode in your life.</li>
          <li>The more times a phone number is repeated in an ad, the less trustworthy the ad seems.</li>
