        <ul>
          <li>When you close one eye, you see nothing through that eye (not even black). But when you close both eyes, you see black.</li>
          <li>LEGO is one of the only companies that can release an almost infinite number of new products, without actually creating any new products.</li>
          <li>GoFundMe is turning into the internet version of panhandling.</li>
          <li>Someday you will take a picture of yourself - or someone will take one of you - not knowing it will be your memorial picture when you die.</li>
          <li>No one has seen you look worse than the gas station closest to your house.</li>
          <li>When cousins from both sides of the families meet itâ€™s like a special crossover episode in your life.</li>
          <li>The more times a phone number is repeated in an ad, the less trustworthy the ad seems.</li>
